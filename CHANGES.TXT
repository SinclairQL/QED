                                QED Version 2
                                =============


    This textfile describes the changes introduced in QED v2, compared
    to v1.01.

    v2.02 released 03 October 2018
    ==============================

    New features
    ------------

    - The RC command can now be used to load a file in cooked mode. It is
      equivalent to the R command, except that CR/LF line endings are converted
      to LF and TABS compressed or expanded according to the TAB compression
      and expansion settings.
      Note that both R and RC commands currently do not accept a filename
      containing spaces as parameter. These files can be loaded by using the R
      or RC command without a parameter and then entering the file name at the
      'File Name:' prompt.

    - Help file didn't mention the F6 key (toggle Auto Indent), F7 key (toggle
      Word Wrap), F9 key (toggle TAB expansion), and F10 key (toggle TAB
      compression). Their status is now shown in the status line.

    - The manual has (at last!) been updated for version 2.

    Bug fixes
    ---------

    - Using the R command without a file name caused QED to crash with an
      invalid file name. It now asks for the file name as expected.

    - After using the QF or XF command, the status line was garbled.

    Known issues
    ------------

    Options specified on the command line along with file names currently don't
    take effect.


    v2.01 released 25 September 2018
    ================================

    New Features
    ------------

    - Multi-file editing is now possible. This can be done by
      specifying multiple filenames on the commandline, e.g.:

      EX QED;'fred_c jim_asm peter_pas'

      which will load the files fred_c, jim_asm and peter_pas into
      QED. One file will be displayed at a time (in this case the
      first file specified on the commandline). Pressing F5 will
      switch the display to the next file in a circular fashion, like
      the CTRL-C key does when switching jobs. Note that if only one
      file is being edited, the F5 key behaves as in v1.01 (i.e. it
      updates the display).
      There is no limit on the number of files QED can handle, other
      than the restrictions imposed by the amount of available
      memory.

      The multi-file editing capability alters the functionality of
      some commands in QED:
      - The "Q" command, used to quit QED, scans the list of files
        being edited to see if changes have been made to the text.
        If so, you will be prompted if you want to lose the changes.
        Pressing Y will lose the changes in the current file,
        pressing N will abort the command leaving the displayed file
        active.

      - The "R" command will no longer discard the current file.
        Instead, the specified file will be loaded and displayed
        while the current file will remain active. Thus, each time
        you do a "R" command a new file will be added to the list of
        files being edited.
        The string parameter of the "R" command may be the name of
        the new file and possible commandline options. An empty
        parameter is allowed, in which case QED will prompt you to
        enter it (along with the workspace required).

      - The "X" command now saves ALL files being edited which have
        been modified within QED. Files not modified will NOT be
        saved. After all files have been saved successfully, an exit
        is made from QED.

      - Individual files may be quit (no save) using the QF command
        and saved using the XF command. When completed, these
        commands will display the next file being edited or quit QED
        if there are no active files left.


    - QED now supports AutoIndent. This is an useful feature for
      programmers in languages such as C, Assembly and Pascal which
      use indented text for clarity.
      When AutoIndent mode is on and you reach a new line due to
      pressing ENTER or wordwrapping, QED will note the column
      position of the first non-blank character on the previous line 
      (or the line before the previous if that line is blank, and so 
      on). The cursor on the new line will then be put on that column
      position, so that you won't have to TAB to it for each line.
      If you need to TAB back to the previous tab stop, e.g. when
      reaching the end of a { }-construction in C, you can now use
      SHIFT-TAB to move the cursor left to the previous tab stop.
      AutoIndent can be toggled on and off by pressing the SHIFT-F1
      (or F6) key or issuing the TA command.

    - QED now can handle files containing TAB characters. This is
      configurable through two settings: the "Expand TABs" option and
      the "Compress TABs" option.
      The "Expand TABs" option controls the handling of TAB
      characters in the display. When OFF, TABs will not be expanded
      and thus will look like funny characters in the file (as they
      did in v1.01). When ON, TABs will be displayed as one or more
      space characters as you would expect when using the TAB key.
      This will involve a small speed penalty however, so if you
      never use files containing TABs you may disable TAB-expansion
      to get full speed.
      The "Compress TABs" option controls the physical storage of 
      TABs in the file. When OFF, no TABs will be output (as in
      v1.01). When ON, QED will replace occurrences of one or more
      space characters in a line by TAB characters where appropriate.
      In programming source files, this will often reduce the file
      size considerably.
      It should be noted that QED will only compress TABs in _edited_
      lines, not the lines of the file which were not altered during
      an edit session! This can be overcome by loading a file in
      "Cooked" mode - see the manual.
      The "Expand TABs" option can be toggled using the TE command; 
      the "Compress TABs" option can be toggled using the TC command.

    - The Toolkit II default data directory is now supported when
      processing filenames.

    - When saving a file using the SA or X command, any existing file
      is now renamed to <filename>_OLD when the new version is
      written.

    - When Writing a Block to an existing file, a prompt is displayed
      to either overwrite or append to this file.

    - Both the command input (F3 or SHIFT-F3) and the filename and
      workspace prompts can now be aborted by pressing the arrow-up
      or -down key (On systems equipped with the Minerva ROM, the ESC
      key can also be used).

    - A space may now be used as separator character when entering
      commands requiring a string parameter, if the string itself
      does not contain spaces. E.g. "F wombat" attempts to find the
      string "wombat".
      The old syntax (using a non-alphanumeric separator) is still
      allowed, so it's still possible to have strings with spaces or
      reserved characters (brackets and semicolon) in it.

    - The "Shift-Space" key combination now gives a "normal" space.


    Bug fixes
    ---------

    - When joining two lines resulted in a line longer than 254
      characters, QED locked up. This has been fixed now.

    - Deleting the entire file using a DB command resulted in a
      crash. Fixed now.
