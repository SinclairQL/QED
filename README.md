# QED
QED is a compact and fast text editor for the Sinclair QL, written in 68000 Assembly. Originally released in 1988, work continued on a v2.xx version until 1994 but was never publicly released.

This is the most recent version 2.02 which includes several enhancements like auto-indent, TK2 default directories and editing multiple files simultaneously. The manual, Help file and configuration program QEDCONFIG_BAS have also been updated and are included in the distribution file QED202.ZIP.
